        <h2>My name is John living the simple life saved my life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I
          thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any
          of it because there was too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
          want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
        </p>
        <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
        <p>
          <strong
            >I was on the verge of breakdown when I got rid of
            everything</strong
          >. I literally put 90% of my possesions in the garbage, sold my place
          and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my Job.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
          place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
        </p>
        <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I'm liveing a simple life, things are so much beter. I'm less
          stessed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          With how much it turned my life around,<strong
            >I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it </strong
          >, and how others can benefit from iving a simple life as well, which
          is why I started this site!
